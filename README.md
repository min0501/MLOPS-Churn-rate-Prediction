# 📊 MLOps Card Customer Churn Prediction Project





## 🔍 Project Description
This project is a Python-based MLOps tool aimed at predicting the churn rate of credit card customers. It uses various machine learning algorithms to analyze customer data and predict the likelihood of customer churn. The goal of this project is to help credit card companies retain their customers by identifying those who are most likely to churn.





## ✨ Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, transform, and filter data to prepare it for machine learning algorithms.
- **Model Training**: Train multiple machine learning models using customer data.
- **Prediction**: Predict the churn rate of customers based on the trained models.
- **Model Retraining**: Retrain the model with new data to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Visualization**: Generate graphs to visualize the prediction results.





## 🛠 Installation Guide
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone {github repository url}
```
2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```





## 🧪 Testing
The testing of this project is done using the test dataset. The performance of the model is evaluated based on its prediction accuracy on the test dataset. 





## 🚀 Deployment
The project is deployed using Dash, a Python framework for building analytical web applications. The prediction results are presented in a user-friendly dashboard.
